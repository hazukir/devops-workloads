# some useful commands to use in the terminal

pwd = print working directory aka find out where you are.

ls = list directories and files
    * ls -a = list all including hidden files and directories
    * ls -al = same as above but it shows in a list  format. 
    Also it is possible to create an alias for this command with < alias ll='ls -al' >. 
    If you want to remove the alias, just use "unalias ll".
    * ls -R ~/Documents = will list all the directories and files recursively 

cd = change directories.

history = to check the history of commands use.
    history 10 = return the 10 most recent commands.

adduser = to add new user, but one must use "sudo" because it is an administrative operation. It will ask to set password
and some other configurations.
    ex: sudo adduser new_user

addgroup = in the current user, you can add the new user to the "sudo" and "adm" group for example.
    ex: sudo usermod -aG sudo,adm new_user
    Please do not use "sudo usermod -aG sudo, adm new_user" because there is a space after sudo and it will return
    "usermod: group '' does not exist"
    -a, --append                  append the user to the supplemental GROUPS
    -G, --groups GROUPS           new list of supplementary GROUPS

su = also known as switch user - switch to new user. It will ask for password.
    ex: su - new_user

man for manual = this is very helpful to check the help for the commands you're using.
    ex: man ls

cp = used to copy files or directories 
    ex: cp ~/Downloads/myfile.txt ~/Documents = move the file from Downloads to Documents.
    ex: cp -r ~/Downloads/01_ISOS/ ~/Documents/
        
        -r/-R = to copy recursively the files and subdirectories under the "01_ISOS" directory.
        -f, --force
        -i, --interactive
        -v, --verbose
