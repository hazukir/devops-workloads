# Basic Navigation (Normal Mode)

Stop using the arrow keys! Keep your hands on the "home row" to move faster.

    h : Move Left

    j : Move Down

    k : Move Up

    l : Move Right

    w : Jump to the start of the  word.

    b : Jump back to the start of the previous word.

    0 (zero) : Jump to the start of the line.

    $ : Jump to the end of the line.

    gg : Jump to the top of the file.

    G : Jump to the bottom of the file.


# Editing Text(i)

These commands are "verbs." You can combine them with numbers (e.g., 3dd deletes 3 lines).

    i : Insert before the cursor.

    a : Append after the cursor.

    o : Open a new line below and enter Insert mode.

    x : Delete a single character.

    dd : Delete (cut) the entire line.

    dw : Delete word (from cursor to start of next word).

    u : Undo the last action.

    Ctrl + r : Redo.

    yy : Yank (copy) a line.

    p : Paste after the cursor.


# Saving and Quitting (Command Mode)

All these start by pressing : while in Normal Mode.

    :w : Write (Save) the file.

    :q : Quit.

    :wq : Write and Quit (Save and Exit).

    :q! : Force Quit (Discard unsaved changes).

    :set number : Turn on line numbers.


# The "Vim Language" Secret

Vim commands are actually a language. Once you know the "Verbs" and "Nouns," you can talk to your editor:

    d (Delete) + w (Word) = dw

    c (Change) + i (Inside) + " (Quotes) = ci" (Deletes everything inside quotes and lets you type something new).

    y (Yank/Copy) + $ (End of line) = y$ (Copy from cursor to the end of the line).


Getting used to vim. It's going to be a fun ride learning to use this editor
