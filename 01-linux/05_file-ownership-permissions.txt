# change ownership of a file

sudo chown tester 05_file-ownership-permissions.txt 

# change ownership of a group

sudo chgrp devops 05_file-ownership-permissions.txt

Notes: When change ownership of a file you will not be able to alter it, meaning you cannot save the changes.



# file permissions

drwxrwxr-x 2 hazukir hazukir 4096 Feb 12 16:26 ./

d = directory
first block -> rwx == read, write, execute - applies to user
second block -> rwx == read, write, execute - applies to group
r -x == means it belongs to everybody else which is not "hazukir".


-rw-rw-r-- 1 hazukir hazukir 2049 Feb 10 10:57 01_commands.txt
the dash(-) after write means there are no execution permissions for the file.



# change permissions

sudo chmod -x 01-linux == remove the execute permissions from 01-linux directory from user.

ex: drw-rw-r-- 2 hazukir hazukir 4096 Feb 12 16:26 01-linux/

sudo chmod +x 01-linux == give execute permissions to user.


## add permissions to group 
sudo chmod g+x 01_commands.txt 

## add permissions to user 
sudo chmod u+x read_files.sh

### adding permissions
g+x = group + execute
u+x = user + execute
o+x = other + execute



### removing permissions
g-x = group - execute
u-x = user - execute
o-x = other - execute

## we can add or remove all permissions to users and groups by doing either of the following:

sudo chmod -x read_files.sh 
sudo chmod a-x read_files.sh

a-x == means remove permissions for all.



## give bulk permissions to a group

sudo chmod g=rwx fetch-names.sh 
rw- == only read and write permissions
r-- == only read permissions

for all users and groups use: 
sudo chmod a=rwx fetch-names.sh 


## using numeric values
