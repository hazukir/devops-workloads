# User categories

super user/ root = unrestricted permissions.

user = regular user. can have its own dedicated space and also can normal and belong to adm, sudo or other groups.

service user = for server distros
service users can not be root users for security purposes and other reasons.




# check users registered on the system

cat /etc/passwd -> displays the 


hazukir:x:1000:1000:Helder,,,:/home/hazukir:/bin/bash

USERNAME: PASSWORD : UID : GID : GECOS : HOMEDIR : SHELL

x = encrypted
1000 = password
1000 = UID 
GID
GECOS
HOMEDIR
SHELL


password can be found here, but obviously is  encrypted:
cat /etc/shadow
